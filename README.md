A Powerful Table Management System
This system targets to build a small yet powerful table management system to manage the few tables of different sizes in a family-owned deli regarding the occupancy, reservation, and billing, etc. of these tables. 
In details, the system will have below basic functions:
1) Check whether a table is available or occupied.
2) Occupy a table.
3) Release a table.
4) Suggest a vacant table with minimal enough seats concerning the number of customers.
5) Notify the waiter for tables occupied for too long.
Since the customer base changes on a seasonal basis, the system will allow changes to the number of tables and the size of the tables. Imagine putting the system to production and please think of a function not aforementioned, and add the function to your system.
